# This Node.js code sets up a basic Express server that provides two main endpoints for handling file operations.

 https://nodejs-filesystem-8syx.onrender.com/

1)The /create-file endpoint creates a new text file in the TextFiles directory. It generates a file name based on the current date and time, and writes the current timestamp as the file content. The server responds with a success message if the file is created successfully, or an error message if there is a problem.

2)The /list-files endpoint reads the contents of the TextFiles directory and returns a list of file names.

Additionally, there is a default route that handles any other requests and responds with a 404 error message for paths that do not match any defined routes.

Overall, this server provides a simple API for creating text files with timestamps and listing existing files, demonstrating basic file system operations in a Node.js environment using Express.
